Single-responsibility principle

Each module, class, or function is responsible for one thing and encapsulates only that part of the logic.

- Readability: Short classes are easier to read. There is no hard and fast rule
but many developers set a limit of 200-300 lines. Determine for yourself
or as a team what constitutes “short.” When you exceed this threshold,
decide if you can refactor it into smaller parts.

- Extensibility: You can inherit from small classes more easily.
Modify or replace them without fear of breaking unintended features.

- Reusability: Design your classes to be small and modular so that you can
reuse them for other parts of your game.
